# Read: Class (14) Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## There is some important question we should ask us about Tech Industry

---
<br>

**1-What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?** personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

**2-Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?** In my view, in order for them to be qualified to work on it with high efficiency and to have the ability to solve computer-related problems.

**3-What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?** Microsoft, Apple, and Dell company.

**4-When are diversity efforts most successful?** when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

**5-Why do diverse companies perform better?** because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, so spite of homogeneity is not a counterpoint to the overwhelming evidence that diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.  

**6-Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa?** "that's When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups and When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies."
